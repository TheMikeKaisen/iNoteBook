In the context of web development, middleware refers to a software component or a function that sits between the incoming request and the outgoing response in an application's request-response cycle. It acts as a bridge or a layer of processing that can modify the request or response objects, perform additional tasks, or add functionality to the application.

Middleware functions are executed sequentially, allowing them to intercept the request and response objects and perform various operations on them. These operations can include tasks such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, session management, and more.

In the code we added a middleware function.
